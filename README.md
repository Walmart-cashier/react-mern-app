If you have docker simply run the app using following commands
``docker-compose build``
``docker-compose up``

Or

Install required dependencies with ``npm install`` and run the development build (backend + client) with ``npm run dev`` 

If you want to just run the backend do ``npm run backend``

A live instance of the app is running on http://react-mern-app.herokuapp.com
